### Highlights of the theme
> Minimalistic Light theme

> Made from C++ point of View

> Function Calls are highlighted in bold, so easy to differentiate within a look

> Arguments passed in the function would hold the same colour throughout its scope in the current function

Hope You enjoy the theme! :)
